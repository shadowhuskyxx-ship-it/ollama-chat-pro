It was a U.S. government agency that was responsible for managing federal health care programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. The HCFA was part of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and played a significant role in ensuring the financing and administration of these critical health insurance programs.\n\nIn 2002, the HCFA was merged with other agencies to form the **Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)**. The CMS now serves as the primary federal agency overseeing Medicare and Medicaid, continuing the work that HCFA began. This merger aimed to streamline administrative functions and enhance coordination between various health care programs.\n\nIn summary:\n- **HCFA** (Health Care Financing Administration) was an agency responsible for managing Medicare and Medicaid.\n- It was later merged with other agencies in 2002 to form the **Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)**, which continues its mission today.",
